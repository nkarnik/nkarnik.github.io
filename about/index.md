I am an adult human currently living in San Francisco by way of Columbia, MD. I never bothered setting up a personal website until I randomly checked the availability of [nikhilkarnik.com](http://nikhilkarnik.com). I bought my domain as fast as I could type and click. I had no experience with static site generators, so I appropriated a great open source theme (So Simple Theme) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a very popular static site generator. And the rest is history, as they say...

## Websites I Read Often:

* [Deadspin](http://deadspin.com)
* [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)
* [Quora](http://quora.com)
