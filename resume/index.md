My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.
 
    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.
 
Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...
 
Programming Languages
:   **python:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end.
 
:   **java:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 
 
:   **ruby:** 
 
:   Prior experience with **C**, **Go**, **Javascript**, **Bash**
